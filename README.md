## Motivation Behind This Project
There are a lot of people out there that want to try martial arts but are too afraid to because they are worried they may not be good enough. Or maybe they haven’t been active for a while because they lost motivation due to a busy life. Or they stopped because they felt like they were not learning anymore. I had all of those feelings at many times during my life. But this app changes that because it helps you realize you are not alone and there are many people out there just like you. By creating an app that allow  users to showcase their skills and/or to learn from others, it brings people closer together and motivates them to stay active and reignite their passion for martial arts. Additionally, this app helps practitioners improve upon their technique and continue to learn something new from other users. There are people out there that don’t have the skills you do but that doesn’t mean you are better than them, that just means you have the chance to showcase your skills and help them improve. On the other hand, there are people out there that are more skillful than you but that doesn’t mean you are worst than them, that just means you have the opportunity to learn from them and improve.
For me personally, I practiced martials arts for a while and wanted to share what I mastered with others while also learning new kicks from others. Martial arts is not just some sport or activity, it’s a lifestyle and it's your time to live it!
